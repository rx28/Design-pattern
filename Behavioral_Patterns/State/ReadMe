State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its
behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the
object changed its class.

Example:

In the mystical land of Binaryburg, there lived a Chameleon with the power to change
between two states: State 0 and State 1. Its friend, the Wizard of Context, crafted
a magical device called the Context to help manage these transitions.
When the Chameleon's state changed, the Context ensured it smoothly transitioned between
its vibrant colors, showcasing the power and simplicity of the State design pattern in
action.
