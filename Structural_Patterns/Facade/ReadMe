Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of
classes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
In this example, the VideoConverter class acts as the facade, abstracting the complexity
of video conversion operations. Clients simply call the convert() method of VideoConverter to
initiate the conversion process without needing to understand the internal workings of the subsystem.
