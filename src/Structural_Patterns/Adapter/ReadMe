Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example of the Adapter pattern is based on the classic
conflict between square pegs and round holes.
The Adapter pretends to be a round peg, with a radius equal to a half of the squareâ€™s diameter
(in other words, the radius of the smallest circle that can accommodate the square peg).
