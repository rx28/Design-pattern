Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate
hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

Example:
This example illustrates how the Bridge pattern can help divide the monolithic code of an app that manages devices and
their remote controls.
The Device classes act as the implementation, whereas the Remote act as the abstraction.
