Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their
concrete classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
Imagine that youâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your
code consists of classes that represent:
1. A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa .
2. Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa are available in these variants: Modern ,Old.

You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get
quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.
