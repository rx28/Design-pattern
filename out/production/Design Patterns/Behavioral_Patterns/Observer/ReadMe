Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a
subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any
events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:

In the city of Observerville, avid readers Alice, Bob, and Carol eagerly await
updates from BookBuzz Publishing House. Using the Observer pattern, BookBuzz
notifies its subscribers about new book releases and literary events. When BookBuzz
announces a mystery novel, Alice gets a tailored notification about her favorite genre,
while Bob receives updates on science fiction, and Carol on historical fiction. Through this pattern,
BookBuzz effectively keeps its readers engaged and connected, creating a vibrant literary community in
Observerville.
