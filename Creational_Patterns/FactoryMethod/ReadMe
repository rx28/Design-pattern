Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows
subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Example:
This example illustrates how the Factory Method can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the
client code to concrete UI classes.

The base dialog class uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may
look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently.
A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.
