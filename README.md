# Acknowledgement

The code in this repository was developed as part of a learning exercise on design patterns, with guidance from the book "Design Patterns in Java" by Alexander Shvets. The book provided valuable explanations and examples of various design patterns.
While working on this project, I referred to the book for understanding the concepts and implementations of the design patterns. However, the code in this repository is my own implementation, with modifications and adaptations made to suit my specific requirements.

I would like to express my gratitude to Alexander Shvets for writing such an informative book on design patterns, which served as a valuable reference throughout this learning process.
